    # Notes: 
    # The second parameter (here using an underscore (_), 
    # allows methods to be mapped together. 
    # Since we are not chaining anything together, we use 
    # the Python convention of an underscore to indicate 
    # that we wonâ€™t use this parameter. The line parameter 
    # will be the line of text taken from the raw input file.

    # Notes:
    # The values parameter is a list of values created in the
    #  mapper function. We want to sum all of these values. 
    # Recall that from the mapper function the yield was used 
    # to produce multiple outputs. With the reducer we'll 
    # produce the key and sum of all the values assigned with it:
